### Gate visualization

Inspired by Logism, an application used when I attended CPSC 121 to help visualize logic gates.

This project is still under constant development, as it is far from done.

The basic model of the project is done, implemented entirely using Java and Swing.

After it's done, I will try and migrate this object to HTML.

#### TODO:
* implement a cycle detection to support models with loops.
* implement saving and loading files.
* update UI to be more user-friendly.
